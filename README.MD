### Overview:
You will create the game of Blackjack that can be played inside your command line.

 

To get started, you will be given a skeleton project with the following 'classes:

Game - class with the functionality of the game
Card - class with the properties of a card
Deck - class with the properties of a deck
Suits - class with suit values in a deck of cards
Values - class with rank values in a deck of cards
 

You will then fill in these classes to create a game of Blackjack using OOP concepts and other concepts that have been covered throughout the course.

Project Requirements:
 

Requirements for level 1 (Must meet to complete the project):
There are 5 stages that your chatbot will go through:

Create a playing deck of cards that can be shuffled
Deal a hand to the player
Play a game of blackjack
Determine the winner
Calculate the player's new balance
 

Requirements for level 2 (optional):
Only allow the player to bet in increments of 5
Allow players to double down (bet double their initial bet before they hit / are dealt another card)
 

Requirements for level 3 (optional):
Allow players to split their cards (play two hands in unison if their two cards are the same value. Example - player dealt two Aces)
 

 

Please review the requirements for level one and be sure your project meets the minimum requirements.

 

Upon completion, upload your GitHub repo URL to this assignment.  Make sure the URL ends in .git or else it won't be accepted. (That means it is at the root folder of your project, not to a specific class reference.
